# A.I. Breast Cancer Detection - A Tool To Assist Oncologists

### A convolutional neural network approach to detecting malignant tumors in breast cancer tissue. 
##### Developed by Ravish Rawal at Columbia University.

\
Despite incredible advances in imaging technology, breast cancer can be difficult to detect in tissue slides with the unaided human eye. The CAMELYON16 dataset provides a small set of cancerous breast tissue slides, annotated by oncologists to show malignant areas.

This project adopts a sliding window approach to:

1. Extract patches
2. Classify patches
3. Train a classifier using this labelled dataset
4. Fine tune the classifier
5. Generate a heatmap to predict and display cancerous regions

#### Results:

* Precision:  95.16 %
* Recall:  93.65 %
